  "title": "Documenting a (new) widget",
  "permalink": "http:\/\/www.tidev.io\/2014\/06\/18\/documenting-a-new-widget\/",
  "content": "After reading Ronald Treur's article about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tidev.io\/2014\/05\/14\/duckumentation\/\">Duckumentation<\/a> on tiDev I decided to give <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/senchalabs\/jsduck\">JSDuck<\/a> a try for some projects and a new widget I was working on. In this blog I want to share my approach for documenting Alloy widgets. I'm looking forward to hear your ideas, so please leave a comment!\n\n<h3>New Alloy Form widget<\/h3>\n\nThe new widget I've used as an example here is a widget to create a <code>Ti.UI.TableView<\/code> based form which is both easy to implement, customise and extend.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Source code: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/FokkeZB\/nl.fokkezb.form\/tree\/master\">https:\/\/github.com\/FokkeZB\/nl.fokkezb.form\/tree\/master<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Documentation: <a href=\"http:\/\/form.fokkezb.nl\">http:\/\/form.fokkezb.nl<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Test app: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/FokkeZB\/nl.fokkezb.form\/tree\/test\">https:\/\/github.com\/FokkeZB\/nl.fokkezb.form\/tree\/test<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>GitHub pages<\/h3>\n\nI wanted to publish the documentation online with minimal effort. Since the widget lives on GitHub, using <a href=\"https:\/\/pages.github.com\">GitHub pages<\/a> was the logical choice. This requires the repo to have a <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/FokkeZB\/nl.fokkezb.form\/tree\/gh-pages\">gh-pages<\/a> branch which will be served as a website.\n\n<h3>Working copies<\/h3>\n\nBecause JSDuck generates most of the documentation from inline docblocks in the code, I have set up multiple working copies on my local machine as follows:\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>~\/form\/master<\/code>: the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/FokkeZB\/nl.fokkezb.form\/tree\/master\">master<\/a> branch.<\/li>\n<li><code>~\/form\/gh-pages<\/code>: the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/FokkeZB\/nl.fokkezb.form\/tree\/gh-pages\">gh-pages<\/a> branch.<\/li>\n<li><code>~\/form\/test<\/code>: the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/FokkeZB\/nl.fokkezb.form\/tree\/test\">test<\/a> branch.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\nThis way I can keep the <code>master<\/code> repo clean by having all <code>jsduck-*.json<\/code> files in the <code>gh-pages<\/code> repo, just like I do for <a href=\"http:\/\/form.fokkezb.nl\/docs\/#!\/guide\/testing\">testing<\/a>. When I execute <code>$ jsduck<\/code> in the <code>gh-pages<\/code> branch it looks for code in <code>..\/master<\/code>, as the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/FokkeZB\/nl.fokkezb.form\/blob\/gh-pages\/jsduck.json\">jsduck.json<\/a> file shows:\n\n[crayon-53a988a328d9c242984608\/]\n\n<h3>Re-using README<\/h3>\n\nTo stay DRY, I have re-used the <code>master<\/code> branch's <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/FokkeZB\/nl.fokkezb.form\/blob\/master\/README.md\">README<\/a> as the welcome page. I also wanted to use the <code>test<\/code> branch <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/FokkeZB\/nl.fokkezb.form\/blob\/test\/README.md\">README<\/a> for the <a href=\"http:\/\/form.fokkezb.nl\/docs\/#!\/guide\/testing\">testing<\/a> guide, but this unfortunately copied the whole test app into the guides. Of course I could still use Grunt to copy only the README before running <code>jsduck<\/code> if I wanted.\n\n<h3>Namespacing<\/h3>\n\nI want to be able to also use JSDuck to generate documentation for an app, <em>including<\/em> this and other widgets it uses. This is why I namespaced the widget controllers and libraries as <code>Widgets.nlFokkezbForm.controllers.*<\/code> instead of just. <code>controllers.field<\/code>. In an app's documentation this will look like:\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/FokkeZB\/nl.fokkezb.form\/blob\/gh-pages\/guides\/documentation\/namespacing.png?raw=true\" \/>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <strong>NOTE:<\/strong> I was in doubt between <code>nlFokkeZB<\/code> and <code>nl.fokkezb.form<\/code>. The last would also group different widgets under <code>nl.fokkezb.*<\/code>, but make the tree deeper and thus more difficult to navigate.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<h3>Constructors<\/h3>\n\nThe code you're writing as Alloy controllers are ultimately <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/appcelerator\/alloy\/blob\/master\/Alloy\/template\/component.js#L16\">wrapped by Alloy<\/a> in a <code>Controller<\/code> function exported as the CommonJS module.\n\n[crayon-53a988a328db1068889799\/]\n\nSince I can't inject a docblock here, but also because I like to keep my controller code organized, I always wrap the controller's code to be executed at creation in a self-executing method like this:\n\n[crayon-53a988a328dba484914293\/]\n\nNow I can simply document this as:\n\n[crayon-53a988a328dd1154107788\/]\n\nIf I'd leave out <code>@method<\/code> then JSDuck would warn about finding an unnamed method, because it's self-executing. If I'd use <code>@constructor<\/code> instead, then JSDuck would use the class and show something like:\n\n<ul>\n<li>new <strong>Widgets.nlFokkezbForm.controllers.widget<\/strong>( args ) : <em>Widgets.nlFokkezbForm.controllers.widget<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\nInstead I use <code>@method Controller<\/code> so that the documentation stays close to how it works in the compiled Alloy controller code.",

Though it's pretty awesome to have the conference close to home, it does mean there will be less to explore outside of the conference for me this time ;-) I guess I'll use this time to track every Dutch developer down in order to promote our monthly <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Amsterdam-Titanium\">Amsterdam Titanium Meetup<\/a>. And with some luck, I might be able to help out those of you visiting from abroad with any questions you might have!\n\n<h3>You and development, how did that start?<\/h3>\n\nI think I was about fourteen years old when my dad told me we would be getting an internet connection. The next day I visited my local library and borrowed whatever books I could find on HTML. Having started teaching myself how to program a few years earlier (Basic mostly) and knowing I wanted to be a developer, I couldn\u2019t wait to create my very own personal presence on the web. I had the first iteration of my personal homepage finished before our modem had even arrived, and I have been busy creating websites ever since. Later on I studied Computer Science with the idea to get into the gaming industry, but afterwards there were simply too many great opportunities that allowed me to remain on the fore-front of web-development, so I simply kept at it.\n\n<h3>And how did you go from web to app?<\/h3>\n\nAbout three years ago a I started a company, together with my co-founder Timan Rebel, called <a href=\"http:\/\/snowcietyapp.com\">Snowciety<\/a>. Our aim was to create a better mobile experience for wintersport enthusiasts. There already were a few apps out there that logged your speed and distance throughout the day, but we knew we could do better than that. We wanted to add a strong social layer, since most of us who go skiing or snowboarding take their friends and family with them. They are not working out, they're enjoying their time on the snow, together.\n\n<h3>So why Titanium?<\/h3>\n\nWith neither of us having any prior app-building experience, we looked around and decided to give Titanium a try. Coming from a web-development background, we already had a fair amount of JavaScript experience, so we got off to a quick start. However, Titanium three years ago was a far cry from what we're used to nowadays. It lacked a great many features, was riddled with bugs and didn't yet have the vibrant community it has today. We kept on using it however as it showed great promise. And I am happy we did!\n\n<h3>How did you see Titanium evolve since then?<\/h3>\n\nToday things are very different. Titanium has matured, Alloy is clear proof of this and though some bugs remain - they always do - these mostly occur in edge cases only. The community has blossomed and expanded as well, with <a href=\"http:\/\/ticonf.org\">tiConf<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tidev.io\">tiDev.io<\/a> as shining examples of its power and enthusiasm. I am happy to be a part of it!\n\n<h3>Can you share some of your contributions?<\/h3>\n\nI have been co-organising the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Amsterdam-Titanium\">Amsterdam Titanium Meetup<\/a> for a while. A presentation I gave there earlier this year, on the Single threaded nature of Titanium was well received and is the reason I am also presenting (it) at tiConf EU in Amsterdam. Because it\u2019s a relatively complex topic I also wrote a lengthy (3-part) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tidev.io\/2014\/02\/17\/keeping-your-app-responsive-part-1\">article<\/a> on the topic at TiDev.io.\n\nAfter having submitted my proposal for TiConf, I have been working on two open-source projects that might be of interest. The first is a (heavily WIP) mini-framework called <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/RonaldTreur\/graviton.TaskManager\">graviton.TaskManager<\/a> that should help developers improve the responsiveness of their apps. The second is a module for Alloy that enables developers to write their TSS using a more <a href=\"http:\/\/sass-lang.com\">syntactically awesome style sheet language<\/a>, which I\u2019ve dubbed <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/RonaldTreur\/STSS\">STSS<\/a>. If writing Sassy TSS sounds as good to you as it does to me, then please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npmjs.org\/package\/stss\">download the latest version<\/a> and help me test it.\n\n<h3>How do you see the future of Titanium?<\/h3>\n\nI couldn't be happier with the prospect of Ti.Next and Alloy 2.0. These new version will really move the platform to a whole nother level. Switching to a different platform has never occurred to me. If not Titanium then I would be developing natively. So far speed was the only argument native development had going, but when Ti.Next will be released to the public, none remain!\n\n<h3>Why should people check out your talk at tiConf?<\/h3>\n\nThey should attend because what I am about to explain will definitely improve the apps they create using Titanium. I met quite a few Titanium developers who blamed Titanium for their app being unresponsive at times. My message to those attending:\n\n<blockquote>\n  \"It's not Titanium you dummy! You're simply not doing it right!\"\n<\/blockquote>\n\nSounds arrogant? I agree, but feedback so far has led me to believe this holds true for a very large group of developers out there. I guess the only way to find out is by attending! ;-)\n\nThe problem is that no one ever told us to pay attention to this particular issue. So developers are definitely not to blame. Up until December last year I was ignorant of this as well, but now that I figured it out, I hope to spread this knowledge to as many developers as possible.\n\n<h3>So in short, what will your talk be like?<\/h3>\n\nDuring my talk I will explain how to improve the responsiveness of your mobile app. It will be in-depth and possibly a little complex, because I will need to explain what happens under the hood. In short: Due to Titanium's single threaded nature, <em>traffic jams<\/em> occur a lot. When your app's user taps a button, other processes are still being performed, and that 'tap'-event will simply be added to the back of the queue. If you don't manage those jams (or preferably prevent them!) your app will become unresponsive at times. I will explain what causes this, and more importantly: how to solve it!\n\n<h3>Why do you look forward to tiConf yourself?<\/h3>\n\nI had a blast attending the first tiConf in Valencia, Spain in 2013. It will be good to meet some of you I met there last year. And who knows, I might make some new acquaintances!\n\nAs for what I am looking forward to most, that would be those sessions that might help me get more performance out of Titanium. Or rather out of the app created with it. And yes I am aware that my own talk falls into the same category. It simply illustrates my interest in the topic ;-) Last year in Valencia there were some great talks about improving performance as well. And most of them, unlike my presentation this year, shared simple tips you could use right away. I like those talks the best, being a performance-addict myself!\n\nAnd of course I look forward to hearing the latest on Ti.Next and whatever else is going on at Appcelerator!\n\n<em>- Thanks Ronald!<\/em>",

  "content": "<em>Most of our authors are so-called \"Titans\". You can find about 150 of them on <a href=\"http:\/\/map.tidev.io\">DevMap<\/a> and they have badges showing on <a href=\"http:\/\/developer.appcelerator.com\/devlink\">DevLink<\/a>. But what actually is a Titan? What is their role in the Titanium community? And who came up with this program? I got in touch with <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/gdipao\">Gregory DiPaolo<\/a> at Appcelerator to find out for you!<\/em>\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<h3>In one sentence, what is a Titan?<\/h3>\n\nA Titan is the best of the best in our community and are developers who specifically go out of their way to volunteer, give back to the Appcelerator community and help others learn and improve.\n\n<h3>How many Titans are there?<\/h3>\n\nWe have about 250 Titans in the world right now. One of the great things about Titans, and our community in general, is the diversity and worldwide footprint. Whether it\u2019s a Titan running a meetup group in Australia, giving a talk in India, organizing an event in the US, hosting a drinkup in Japan, answering the Q&amp;A from the UK or helping someone with an app in South Africa, there are developers everywhere. It\u2019s amazing to see what these Titans are doing and how they\u2019re giving back to the community and helping others grow. Check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/map.tidev.io\">tiDev DevMap<\/a> to see where are Titans are located.\n\n<h3>Do you remember who came up with it and when?<\/h3>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/fusion94\">Tony Guntharp<\/a>, prior to the first Codestrong in 2011, first <a href=\"http:\/\/www.appcelerator.com\/blog\/2011\/01\/titanium-titan-program\/\">announced on our blog<\/a> on January 28th, 2011.\n\n<h3>Why Titan? Were other names considered?<\/h3>\n\nTitan was a natural derivative of Titanium, so it made sense on that level. And those who remember their Greek mythology, we thought the concept of a Titan, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Titan_(mythology)\">a race immortal giants of incredible strength<\/a>, was a great shoutout to the developers who are incredibly strong using our software and helping with the community. Cheesy, I know, but we think this moniker is warranted.\n\n<h3>What was the original idea behind the program?<\/h3>\n\nAccording to Tony Guntharp, it was based on a similar program in the Linux community (<a href=\"https:\/\/fedoraproject.org\/wiki\/Ambassadors\">Fedora Ambassadors<\/a>) with which he saw success. He always referred to it as a \u201cforce multiplier\u201d, drawing on his military background. Essentially, we would equip the best of the best in our community with everything they needed (and more) to be as successful as possible with our platform. The intended effect would be that the success of this small group would ripple outward, enriching the entire community. And we\u2019ve seen this in the multitude of books, blog posts, conferences, training resources, <a href=\"http:\/\/developer.appcelerator.com\/questions\/newest\">Q&amp;A<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/gitt.io\">OSS contributions<\/a>, etc. The Titans would be our elite force that would train and mobilize the whole of our community.\n\n<h3>How did the program evolve since?<\/h3>\n\nThe program hasn\u2019t evolved that dramatically since its inception. We continue to look for the best of the best and try to equip them with everything they need. What has evolved though are the level of contributions coming out of the Titan group. As an example, take a look at <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/boydleep\">Boydlee<\/a> and all that he is doing to organize <a href=\"http:\/\/ticonf.org \">tiConfs<\/a>. Or yourself and your work with tiDev. Or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/prpatel\">Pratik<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ketan\">Ket<\/a> with all their work on the <a href=\"http:\/\/tiappcamp.org\/\">tiAppCamp<\/a> side. We continue to be blown away at these types of contributions.\n\n<h3>What do you see as the main purpose of Titans nowadays?<\/h3>\n\nWe see the main purpose of the Titans program to be twofold today:\n\n<ol>\n<li>An opportunity for Appcelerator to recognize those doing great work evangelizing our software throughout the community and ensure that they are closely connected to our team and software. We value the feedback Titans provide us with early testing of releases and want to ensure they have a chance to really run releases through the ringer before we roll them out more broadly. It\u2019s also important to get their feedback on features and make sure we\u2019re on the right track and ensuring that they\u2019re useful for the community.<\/li>\n<li>From the Titans perspective, the purpose is to add some formality to the program that encourages and supports the evangelist work that Titans are doing. Titans are volunteering their time to help the community and we want to be provide as much support as we can. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<h3>Any idea why people like doing this? Sounds like a lot of - unpaid - work?!<\/h3>\n\nIt does sound like unpaid work! If we could we would bring all the Titans on staff and have a team of several hundred evangelists. We\u2019re incredibly grateful for the hundreds of Titans who do volunteer their time and knowledge to help others. I\u2019m sure the motivation is different for each Titan, but at the core I believe they enjoy the act of helping others and networking with other like minded developers. Beyond this, the program brings some additional exposure and credibility to Titans and can further help their reputation and development opportunities within local communities.\n\n<blockquote>My friends think my ego was already too big without being called a Titan<footer>- <cite>Malcolm, Titan<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n<h3>How do you recruit new Titans?<\/h3>\n\nWe think the Titan program should maintain a high standard and we want to ensure it includes developers who are the best of the best using Appcelerator and can adequately represent its benefits. So, we look internally to recruit new Titans and ask that Titans nominate other developers who fit the bill. This way we can validate the skills of Titans and ensure that we\u2019re maintaining that high standard. If you\u2019re interested in becoming a Titan, connect with some existing Titans to learn more.\n\n<h3>What is your vision for the future of the program?<\/h3>\n\nWe\u2019d like to find more ways for Titans to continue to contribute to the future of Appcelerator. Whether it\u2019s helping build and maintain modules, providing input and feedback for new builds or representing Appcelerator at conferences, we think Titans are critical in helping grow the community and product.\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<em>Thanks for giving us and our readers some insight in the Titan program Greg!<\/em>",

With careful but simple thought this change will not cause any issues. \u00a0In many cases allowing for this flexibility will improve the overall app design.\n\n<h2>Hang on - didn't that say iPad as well?<\/h2>\n\nYes it most certainly did. \u00a0The iPad has not changed dimensions or aspect ratio since it was first released. \u00a0Yes Retina changed the density, but in reality the dimensions used by most developers have not changed at all. \u00a0So keep in mind; if the iPhone can change, then so can the iPad.",

  "content": "This is one of a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tidev.io\/tag\/3-3-0\/\">series of blogs<\/a> on new features and (breaking) changes in the upcoming Titanium 3.3.0 and Alloy 1.4.0 releases. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.appcelerator.com\/blog\/2014\/05\/announcing-the-3-3-0-beta-of-sdkstudio\/\">Get the beta versions now!<\/a>\n\n<hr \/>\n\nFonts have always been a bit of a management problem in Alloy TSS files.\n\nYou can define fonts as an object including any of <code>fontFamily<\/code>, <code>fontSize<\/code> and <code>fontWeight<\/code>.\u00a0One of the great things about Alloy is you can stack classes for any view. This means you can have one class merge with another one when applied.\n\n<h3>Fonts have always been the poor cousin<\/h3>\n\nWhen it comes to fonts, the ability to combine one or more class per view means the last font declaration actually overrides any other fonts declared.\n\nSo in practice this means;\n\n[crayon-53a988a329e42306421587\/]\n\n[crayon-53a988a329e4f906068434\/]\n\n<h3>Pre-Alloy 1.4<\/h3>\n\nThe label with the id <code>title<\/code> has these rules applied;\n\n<ul>\n<li>Honours <code>Label<\/code> so it has a font object of <code>{ fontSize: 14 }<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Uses <code>.title<\/code> so it becomes <code>{ fontSize: 18 }<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Uses <code>.important<\/code> so it becomes <code>{ fontWeight: \"bold\" }<\/code><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\nIf you are wondering why the font object is not; <code>{ fontSize: 18, fontWeight: \"bold\" }<\/code> you are not alone.\u00a0But it does make sense it you think about it. All properties are overridden at root. So in this case <code>font<\/code> is overridden, NOT the child properties; <code>fontFamily<\/code>, <code>fontSize<\/code> or <code>fontWeight<\/code>.\n\nThis has made it a little hard to manage TSS for fonts and font styles.\u00a0But good news - the changes, they are a coming.\n\n<h3>Alloy 1.4 and higher<\/h3>\n\nUsing our example from before, the rules are now applied as follows;\n\n<ul>\n<li>Honours <code>Label<\/code> so i has a font object of <code>{ fontSize: 14 }<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Uses <code>.title<\/code> so it becomes <code>{ fontSize: 18 }<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Uses <code>.important<\/code> so it becomes <code>{ fontSize: 18, fontWeight: \"bold\" }<\/code><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\nThis is because the child properties of the font object are now deep-merged.\u00a0 Basically they perform as we would have wanted or expected.\n\nRelated links;\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a title=\"font property is not properly being mixed in when using multiple classes\" href=\"https:\/\/jira.appcelerator.org\/browse\/ALOY-752\">Jira ticket; ALOY-752<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>",
